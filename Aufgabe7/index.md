### Giulia's PR

This is a really simple implementation of the feature, which I respect for its simplicity. It did not change many 
things from the original code, which makes it easier to understand. All in all, I am really satisfied with the changes made.

## Yara's PR 

The code is easy to understand and well structured, especially with the ingredient part separated into its own component.
I like that the form gives clear feedback to the user and the success animation is a nice extra.
The logic for adding, updating and removing ingredients makes sense and is implemented cleanly.
One thing that could be improved is using consistent naming for ingredient fields to avoid confusion.
I wish there were more comments to help understand the changes made to the files.
